# f31-fs311

## About The Project

File system created for CMPSC311 as semester project sophomore year using C in Visual Studio Code. This included: writing a user-space device driver for a filesystem that is built on top of a virtual disk drive, translating file system commands into disk operations, including mount, unmount, open, read, write, seek and close for files that are written to the file system; creating a write-through Least Recently Used cache that will support caching sectors in memory; and connecting over a network to another machine on which the disk controller runs.
